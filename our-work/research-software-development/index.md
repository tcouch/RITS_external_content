Research Software Development
=============================
![Research Software Development](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/images/softwaredevelopment.jpg)

Our goal is to enhance UCL’s capacity to produce high quality research software, from the simplest scripts to complex simulations running on state-of-the-art high performance computers.

Overview
--------
The remit of the Research Software Development Team is to:

+ provide researchers at UCL - and their collaborators - with the skills and tools they need to take control of their own software development, helping them create and maintain readable, reliable and efficient research software
+ improve the sustainability of software created at UCL in the face of changes to hardware, staff and funding over time
+ encourage collaboration so that the life of software extends beyond the involvement of any one team or person

We work as collaborators on research projects, providing a full software development service, and act as consultants to researchers on issues relating to their own research software development activities or plans.

We also provide infrastructure and tools, as well as training in programming and software development best practice, such as version control, issue-tracking and testing.

How the services work
---------------------
###Who can use our services?

All of the following services are currently available to UCL researchers and their collaborators. We are also planning to make our services available to external research organisations.

Contact us to [register an interest](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/register-your-interest) or enquire about costs.

###Collaboration and consultation

If you are part of a research team preparing a grant that involves software development, you should consider bringing in the Research Software Development Team as collaborators: you can cost programming effort from our developer teams into the grant. We can provide fractional or full-time effort as needed, throughout the project or at critical intervals.

We can also provide software development effort to UCL research groups on a day-rate basis. This may be useful for research groups who already hold appropriate grant funds.

###Free software development resource

We run a regular call for free software development effort, in line with UCL’s research priorities.

###Software development infrastructure services

We provide infrastructure and tools to help UCL researchers create their own research software in a sustainable, professional manner.

The first phase of this service is a beta-trial of access to GitHub's source code management service which provides great support for version control, issue tracking, and code review, as well as the ability to manage software documentation and websites linked to the source code.
