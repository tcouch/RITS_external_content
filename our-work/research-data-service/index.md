The UCL Research Data service enables safe storage and access for large volumes of research data. The service is available to UCL researchers, their partners and collaborators.

Background
----------

The UCL Research Data service is part of the Research IT Services department. It has been established as a service to help UCL researchers respond to UK Government and funding bodies’ policies that publicly funded research data should be made freely accessible to the widest possible audience. The UK Research Councils and funding bodies are now beginning to explicitly back this policy by requiring researchers to plan in advance how they are going to manage, store and preserve their data beyond the lifetime of their projects.

By using the Research Data Storage and Research Data Archive services UCL researchers, their partners and collaborators will fully comply with the UCL Research Data Policy and in turn fully comply with UK funding bodies’ policies and requirements.

Overview
--------
UCL’s Research Data service is planning a series of services to facilitate better management of digital datasets which are anticipated to be made available to UCL researchers over the course of this calendar year. We will be able to offer the following services to UCL researchers:

+ storage for increasingly large volumes of research data and data products
+ multiple reliable and fast access mechanisms
+ robust security and control over access: who, what, where and when data are shared
+ support for coordinated end-to-end research ‘workflows’ encompassing the use of both data storage and computational resources
+ archiving of data for re-use and citation by the wider academic community after research projects complete
+ a unified data storage infrastructure for UCL, facilitating compliance with research councils’ and funding bodies’ requirements to make appropriate research data available to the widest possible audience.

How the service works
---------------------
Our primary service is the Research Data Storage service which is now open for UCL researchers to use after a successful pilot phase. A UCL Research Data Archive for long term storage of the products of research projects is also in development, with a pilot phase planned for mid-2014. This will fulfil the need for a long term preservation environment for research data once a project has been completed.

In the meantime, UCL researchers, their partners and collaborators interested in the Research Data service can subscribe to our mailing list which will provide updates on the latest developments on this project:

Main features
-------------
The Research Data service in development will benefit from the following:

+ expert team from a variety of research backgrounds who understand the needs and concerns of researchers when it comes to handling high value, high volume or high availability data assets
+ enterprise grade data storage facility to ensure significantly enhanced resilience without the burden of additional project overheads for hardware maintenance
+ dedicated servers managing access to hundreds of terabytes of data, ensuring rapid access to data over UCL’s high speed network infrastructure
+ a facility split across two sites, at opposite ends of the main UCL campus, ensuring a high level of safety and access to data
+ an eventual on-site capacity of 2PB usable storage for fixed periods of tenancy.
