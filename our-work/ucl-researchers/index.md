UCL’s Research IT Services department (RITS) can help any UCL researcher integrate our services into their workflow – from the beginning to the end of the research lifecycle.

We can bridge the gap between research and information technology because our team has experience from a wide range of research backgrounds.

We can:

+ provide free advice and consultancy on any aspect of IT related to your research
+ help you to set up a virtual team of experts from across UCL so that you can work together to solve a problem
+ provide specialist support for high performance computing, software development or data storage.

We constantly monitor feedback from researchers in order to guide the future development of our services and anticipate your needs.

The team
--------
RITS has two facilitators who can help you with general queries relating to research IT.

The facilitation team are:

+ [Jo Lampard](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/our-people/jo) – Senior Research IT Services Facilitator
+ [Dr Tom Couch](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/our-people/tom) – Research IT Services Facilitator
